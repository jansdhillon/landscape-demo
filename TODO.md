# TODO

- Make sure to ask about relationship between Multipass and Juju, and whether we can just remove Multipass from this demo and just use LXD VMs
- Ask about removing variables.txt
    - Will need to confirm with Rajan that this is not especially useful when demoing to customers.
- Distinguish from "Getting started with Landscape" (ie different audiences)
- Do I just need to create an entirely new script?
